# Introduction
This project page documents all the programs I've done since Summer 2018 on Generative Art. Each thumbnail represents a different program that I've done on this project, leading to a subpage that hosts my thoughts, procedures, and results of that experiment.

Please feel free to explore this page, and contact me to discuss my work, suggestions, or new ideas!
