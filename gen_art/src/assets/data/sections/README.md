# Sections Folder
This folder contains markdown files for each generative art piece write up.
Each piece's metadata is added to sections.json in order to be rendered on the main page.
App.js grabs each section data from the sections.json, loading the metadata and creating hyperlinks to the static html pages generated from markdown.

As of now, considering using zero-md or react-markdown to render md files as html.
