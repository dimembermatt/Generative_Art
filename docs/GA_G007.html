        The Belousov-Zharbotinsky reactions is an interesting mathematical model
        of an oscillating chemical reaction. I've heard of it before, but until
        I saw this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL3kVtc-4vY">video</a>
        from NileRed on Youtube did I fully appreciate how mezmerizing it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        This program is essentially a conversion of the Processing code by Alasdair
        Turner in his paper <a href="http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/17241/1/17241.pdf">
        <i>A Simple Model of the Belousov-Zharbotinsky Reaction From First Principles</i></a>
        into a P5 sketch that I could run easily in my browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coincidentally, the way this reaction works in code is remarkably like a
        cellular automata, another type of generative art I have been working with.
        A varying concentration of chemicals, chemical A, B, and C, are spread
        across each pixel in a canvas between the values 0 and 1. After this, for
        each successive pass over the image, the program looks at the surrounding
        pixels, adds up the total concentration of each chemical, and then uses
        that to quantify a new value for the current pixel.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is particularly interesting about Turner's code is that he has a depth
        of two for each color, containing a p and a q variable. The total concentration
        is checked from p, and the new values are written into q. p and q are set
        to 0 and 1, respectively, at the start of the program. At the end of each
        pixel calculation, the following control statements are described:
        <br><br>
        <code>
            if(p == 0){<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;p = 1;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;q = 0;<br>
            }else{<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;p = 0;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;q = 1;<br>
            }
        </code>
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        It seemed confusing at first: why would you change the pixel value right
        after you've modified it from the pixel calculation? What the program is
        <i>actually</i> doing is switching the index that the calculations are
        asking. And it's doing so for each pixel, which means the first pixel
        could be running on p values and the next one running on q values.
        It's a bit beyond me to grasp the full implications of how this works,
        but it does work, and it makes a pretty cool sight.
    </p>

        Here are some other pictures I've made while experimenting with the color
        scheme, and modifying some values here and there to get this to work.
