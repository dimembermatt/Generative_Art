    <h2>G002 - Grids</h2>

        There's a lot of Generative Art ideas you can do with grids. Cellular
        Automata can spawn from cells, pixels can be flashing random colors, and
        structures can be grown from arbitrary points, to name a few.
        This program focuses on the intersections of a visual grid, and mutating
        them (often to the point that the grid is unrecognizable).
    </p>
    <p>
        To start with, I made a set of nodes corresponding to each intersection
        in the grid. I can connect them together by lines to make a real grid,
        and sans a couple edge cases we end up with this:
    </p>
    <!--Insert Grid_0.png here-->
    <img src="description\G002\Grid_0.png">
    <p>
        Next I added an offset to each node, such that each point becomes slightly
        out of place. I check it against the neighboring nodes to make sure it
        doesn't go past them, but they roam around pretty freely.
    </p>
    <p>
        I do that for each frame, and add color to each polygon drawn between
        four nodes. These nodes that form each shape will always be the same,
        but their positions won't, so I get a slightly interesting result:
    </p>
    <!--Insert Grid_1.png here-->
    <img src="description\G002\Grid_1.png">
    <p>
        Over time, they do overlap somewhat, which makes the polygon they corner
        a little darker than the others.
    </p>
    <!--Insert Grid_2.png here-->
    <img src="description\G002\Grid_2.png">
    <p>
        As a side note, the top right and bottom left edges don't have a shape
        attached to them. This is partially because I didn't add an edge case
        for them, which underscores the importance about edge cases and testing.
        For real world systems and products, edge cases are abundant, and although
        you might not think of them, they are bound to pop up and cause errors
        (and migraines). Therefore it's pretty important to test your system
        thoroughly and completely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, this end result is a bit boring. So what I decided to do next is to
        randomly select a set of nodes across the grid and use that to draw a
        bigger, overlapping shape. The number of vertices or nodes for each shape
        vary between certain numbers, and therefore the span of the shape could
        be very large. In addition, the nodes are picked <i>at random</i> and stored
        <i>in order</i>, so the shape can double back across itself and split into
        several connected shapes.
        <br><br>
        Here's the result:
    </p>
    <!--Insert Grid_3.png here-->
    <img src="description\G002\Grid_3.png">
    <p>
        I allowed the lines between the nodes to continue to exist at every frame,
        but removed the fill color. So eventually over time the shapes become
        a nice background shade of grey.

        Here's a gallery of some of the Generative Art I've created with this program.

    <!--G002 gallery-->
    <div class="flex-container">
        <section>
          <button class="accordion"><h2>G002</h2></button>
          <div id="G002Gallery" class="panel"></div>
          <script>
            let G002Container = document.getElementById("G002Gallery");
            let G002Pictures = ["png", "abstract1", "abstract3", "abstract4",
              "abstract5", "abstract6", "abstract7", "babyDinosaur", "abstract2"];
            for (let i = 1; i < G002Pictures.length; i++) {
              let src = "pictures/G002_Drawings/" + G002Pictures[i] + "." + G002Pictures[0];
              let img = new Image();
              img.src = src;
              G002Container.appendChild(img);
            }
          </script>
        </section>
    </div>
    <script>
      let acc = document.getElementsByClassName("accordion");
      for (let i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
        acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
          this.classList.toggle("active");
          let panel = this.nextElementSibling;
          let section = this.parentElement;
          if (panel.style.maxHeight) {
            panel.style.maxHeight = null;
            section.style.width = 48 + "%";
          } else {
            panel.style.maxHeight = panel.scrollHeight + 200 + "px";
            section.style.width = 98 + "%";
          }
        });
      }
