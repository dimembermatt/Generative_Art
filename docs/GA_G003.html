    <h2>G003 - Henon Strange Attractor</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Henon Strange Attractor is a particularly prominent example of chaos theory,
        where slightly different initial conditions can cause a vast difference in
        result. I was delighted when I stumbled over the Henon Phase diagrams
        of <a href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/henonphase/"><i>Paul Bourke</i></a>
        and <a href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/henonPhaseDeep/">
        <i>Jared Tarbell</i></a>.
        <br><br>
        So I decided to make my own.
    </p>
    <!-- insert V1 ridges here -->
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V1\ridges.png">
    <p>
        The first iteration of this program uses the equations:
        <br>
        <script type="math/tex">x_{n+1} = x_n \cos{a} - (y_n - (x_{n2}^2)) \sin{a}</script>
        <br>
        <script type="math/tex">y_{n+1} = x_n \sin{a} + (y_n - (x_{n2}^2)) \cos{a}</script>
        <br><br>
        The general control flow is:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create <i>n</i> amount of particles, each with a random position
            and add them all to a set H.</li>
        <li>For an alpha a (the working version currently uses -15, but feel free
            to experiment), calculate cos(a) and sin(a).</li>
        <li>For each particle, update their position with the equations. If their
            position extends beyond the canvas, reset their position.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The following is my initial result, after coloring the particles after x amount
        rounds and making it that a increases by a linear amount every couple rounds.
        There is an issue of drawing the full shape of the pixel image within the
        canvas size, so I also added a scaling factor (in this case, .1) to shrink
        the resultant image.
    </p>
    <!-- insert colorBurst.png here -->
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V1\colorBurst.png">
    <p>
        Colorful, but not very interesting. After tinkering with alpha values a bit more,
        I started coming out with images such as Ridges at the top of this section
        and Dispersion below.
    </p>
    <!-- insert dispersion.png -->
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V1\dispersion.png">
    <p>
        An interesting artefact of my process, by randomizing the color of each pixel
        and rotating/shifting the general position of the shape every couple rounds,
        is the separation of particles into discrete sections sorted by color.
        The color sections don't seem to have any pattern in which they are sorted,
        which makes the phenomenon even more intriguing. The V1 gallery is below.

            <script>
                let G003V1Container = document.getElementById("G003V1Gallery");
                let G003V1Pictures = ["png", "beams", "colorBurst", "cylindricalSections",

    <h4>Update 8/7/18:</h4>
    <p>
        So V1 looks nice, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. So instead
        I experimented with another set of functions for V2,
        <br>
        <script type="math/tex">x_{n+1} = 1 - a*x(n)^2 + x(n)</script>
        <br>
        <script type="math/tex">y_{n+1} = b*x(n)</script>
        <br><br>
        A little simpler, and hopefully with better results.
        <br><br>
        I used the same process for V1, but instead of checking if the particle
        drops off the canvas, I gave each particle a lifetime and replaced them
        every time they die.
    </p>
    <!-- insert shell.png-->
    <img src="description\G003\shell.PNG">

        And tada! We're getting a pattern here! If we zoom out and let the program
        simmer for a couple minutes..

        The initial values are a(.2) and b(1.01). After experimenting with it, here
        are the visual differences when a and b are altered to the below values.

    <h4>Update 10/29/18:</h4>
    <p>
        I went back and tried the same equations with V1 again, using the lessons
        I've learned from V2 to better bound the object and get it to display,
        but unfortunately this was the best result I could get.

    <p>
        It's a little more interesting, and definitely more in line with what I
        expected V1 to be, but definitely not what Tarbell or Bourke have created.
        A couple sources of error might be the scale that I'm on. It's possible that
        (judging from Bourke's source code for <i>Henon Phase Deep</i>) I may be
        a scale of 10^2 off from the size of the world that these particles move in.

    <h4>Update 1/2/19:</h4>
    <p>
        This update plays with the Standard map, or the Chirikov standard map.
        I was looking into chaotic systems to model chaotic mixing and stumbled
        onto kicked rotators, which led me to the Standard map.

    <p>
        The really interesting thing that occurred while adjusting the parameters
        for this program is the range of maps under different bounds. For example,
        the first image in this update is bounded to p:{-PI, PI}, x:{0, 2 PI}.
        However, images like the first two in the gallery share a very strong
        symmetry when unbounded. There's a somewhat obvious dividing line across
        the center and a less obvious one diagonally (this shows up quite early
        while iterating across the K constant; the maps are split along the diagonal
        and slowly connect as K increases). This underscores the importance of
        bounding conditions when looking for a solution, which gives me another
        insight into why my Henon maps aren't looking up to par.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is a very tall image of the unbounded standard map (P is not modded
        by 2 PI and is no longer periodic). The diagonal symmetry axis is very
        evident at the top, and as you go down the image, you can see the very
        order structure eventually collapsing into noise and chaos.
    </p>
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V4\02.png">
    <h4>Update 3/21/19:</h4>
    <p>
        This update is less of an exploration of more chaos theory and more of a demonstration
        of a port of the previous update into C++ using OpenFrameworks. The expectation
        was to achieve higher speed and greater quality than P5JS, and the results were
        mixed to say the least.
    </p>
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V5\standardMap1.png" style="width:80%">
    <p>
        Above is the one of the first satisfactory images produced from the C++ port.
        While there appears to be satisfactory quality in the image, the time needed
        to produce the image compared to that of the JS sketch was larger by order
        of magnitudes. In addition, the C++ version produced artefacts in the process
        that are particularly visible radially from the center eye. These distortions
        mar the quality of the image.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, an acceptable advantage of the C++ port is that it reduces a shimmering
        effect in the JS sketch that tends to visually hide features in the image.
        By allowing the program to layer hundreds of exposures in the image, high resolution
        features begin to stand out.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a little more tweaking (read: hours more), the program created this
        very nice picture after about 9 hours and 60 thousand exposures.
    </p>
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V5\standardMap4.png" style="width:100%">
    <p>
        This program was massively sped up by using an array instead of
        a vector/array list. Some function calls, such as ofSetColor() were reduced
        by running each particle individually n times (I set n to be the lifetime
        of each particle) before moving to the next particle in the generation,
        and removing extraneous color change instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also replaced the drawing buffer by drawing into an fbo (another renderer),
        and then drawing all the changes at once to the screen at the end of each
        generation. I also got rid of the artefacts by adding a random offset when
        drawing each particle. The image now looks much cleaner as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
        An interesting thing to note is that the colors of each particle were
        decided based on each particle's initial conditions; a closer look into
        the minute details of the picture reveals cohesive and distinct groupings of
        color.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a sufficiently powerful machine, is it possible that even
        more detail is hidden within the noise?
