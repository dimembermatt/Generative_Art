    <h2>G003 - Henon Strange Attractor</h2>

    <p>
        Henon Strange Attractor is a particularly prominent example of chaos theory,
        where slightly different initial conditions can cause a vast difference in
        result. I was delighted when I stumbled over the Henon Phase diagrams
        of <a href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/henonphase/"><i>Paul Bourke</i></a>
        and <a href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/henonPhaseDeep/">
        <i>Jared Tarbell</i></a>.
        <br><br>
        So I decided to make my own.
    </p>
    <!-- insert V1 ridges here -->
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V1\ridges.png">
    <p>
        The first iteration of this program uses the equations:
        <br>
        <script type="math/tex">x_{n+1} = x_n \cos{a} - (y_n - (x_{n2}^2)) \sin{a}</script>
        <br>
        <script type="math/tex">y_{n+1} = x_n \sin{a} + (y_n - (x_{n2}^2)) \cos{a}</script>
        <br><br>
        The general control flow is:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create <i>n</i> amount of particles, each with a random position
            and add them all to a set H.</li>
        <li>For an alpha a (the working version currently uses -15, but feel free
            to experiment), calculate cos(a) and sin(a).</li>
        <li>For each particle, update their position with the equations. If their
            position extends beyond the canvas, reset their position.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The following is my initial result, after coloring the particles after x amount
        rounds and making it that a increases by a linear amount every couple rounds.
        There is an issue of drawing the full shape of the pixel image within the
        canvas size, so I also added a scaling factor (in this case, .1) to shrink
        the resultant image.
    </p>
    <!-- insert colorBurst.png here -->
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V1\colorBurst.png">
    <p>
        Colorful, but not very interesting. After tinkering with alpha values a bit more,
        I started coming out with images such as Ridges at the top of this section
        and Dispersion below.
    </p>
    <!-- insert dispersion.png -->
    <img src="pictures\G003_Drawings\V1\dispersion.png">
    <p>
        An interesting artefact of my process, by randomizing the color of each pixel
        and rotating/shifting the general position of the shape every couple rounds,
        is the separation of particles into discrete sections sorted by color.
        The color sections don't seem to have any pattern in which they are sorted,
        which makes the phenomenon even more intriguing. The V1 gallery is below.
    </p>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <section>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>G003 V1</h2></button>
            <div id="G003V1Gallery" class="panel"></div>
            <script>
                let G003V1Container = document.getElementById("G003V1Gallery");
                let G003V1Pictures = ["png", "beams", "colorBurst", "cylindricalSections",
                    "diffraction", "diffraction2", "dispersion", "pixelSun", "ridges", "vortex"];
                for (let i = 1; i < G003V1Pictures.length; i++) {
                    let src = "pictures/G003_Drawings/V1/" + G003V1Pictures[i] + "." + G003V1Pictures[0];
                    let img = new Image();
                    img.src = src;
                    G003V1Container.appendChild(img);
              }
            </script>
        </section>
    </div>
    <p>
        So V1 looks nice, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. So instead
        I experimented with another set of functions for V2,
        <br>
        <script type="math/tex">x_{n+1} = 1 - a*x(n)^2 + x(n)</script>
        <br>
        <script type="math/tex">y_{n+1} = b*x(n)</script>
        <br><br>
        A little simpler, and hopefully with better results.
        <br><br>
        I used the same process for V1, but instead of checking if the particle
        drops off the canvas, I gave each particle a lifetime and replaced them
        every time they die.
    </p>
    <!-- insert shell.png-->

    <p>
        And tada! We're getting a pattern here! If we zoom out and let the program
        simmer for a couple minutes..

        The initial values are a(.2) and b(1.01). After experimenting with it, here
        are the visual differences when a and b are altered to the below values.

                let G003V2ExpPictures = ["png", "a_2b_93", "a_2b_97", "a_2b1_01", "a_4b1_01",
                    "a_17b1_01", "a2b1_1"];
                for (let i = 1; i < G003V2ExpPictures.length; i++) {

                    let img = new Image();

        After experimenting a lot more with those values, here are some of the more
        interesting results that I came up with:

    <div class="flex-container">
        <section>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>G003 V2</h2></button>

                let G003V2Container = document.getElementById("G003V2Gallery");
                let G003V2Pictures = ["png", "bouquet", "claws", "jellyfish", "outline",
                    "nikeLogo", "strangeObject", "strangeObject2", "brightman"];
                for (let i = 1; i < G003V2Pictures.length; i++) {
                    let src = "pictures/G003_Drawings/V2/" + G003V2Pictures[i] + "." + G003V2Pictures[0];
                    let img = new Image();
                    img.src = src;
                    G003V2Container.appendChild(img);
                }
            </script>
        </section>
    </div>
    <p>
        I went back and tried the same equations with V1 again, using the lessons
        I've learned from V2 to better bound the object and get it to display,
        but unfortunately this was the best result I could get.
    </p>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <section>
            <button class="accordion"><h2>G003 V3</h2></button>
            <div id="G003V3Gallery" class="panel"></div>
            <script>
                let G003V3Container = document.getElementById("G003V3Gallery");
                let G003V3Pictures = ["png", "001", "flowerPetal"];
                for (let i = 1; i < G003V3Pictures.length; i++) {
                    let src = "pictures/G003_Drawings/V3/" + G003V3Pictures[i] + "." + G003V3Pictures[0];
                    let img = new Image();
                    img.src = src;
                    G003V3Container.appendChild(img);
                }
            </script>
        </section>
    </div>
    <p>
        It's a little more interesting, and definitely more in line with what I
        expected V1 to be, but definitely not what Tarbell or Bourke have created.
        A couple sources of error might be the scale that I'm on. It's possible that
        (judging from Bourke's source code for <i>Henon Phase Deep</i>) I may be
        a scale of 10^2 off from the size of the world that these particles move in.
        One day I will probably return to this project and come back with even more
        amazing phase maps, but I'm satisfied with what I have now.
