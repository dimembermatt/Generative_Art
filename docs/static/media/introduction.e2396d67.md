# Introduction
#### August 12th, 2019

**Hello**, this project page documents all (read: most) the programs I've done since Summer 2018 on Generative Art. Each thumbnail represents a different program that I've created, leading to a subpage that hosts my thoughts, procedures, and results of that experiment.

Please feel free to explore this page, and contact me to discuss my work, suggestions, or new ideas!
