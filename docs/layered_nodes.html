<h1>G001 - Layered Nodes</h1>

<h4>October 26th, 2018</h4>

<p>This program experiments with layered nodes and connecting nodes in a branching out circular pattern. Pretty simple.</p>

<p>Each node consists of a x and a y coordinate. It starts with a shape in the center, a set of nodes that are vertices to a polygon. Then for each vertice, <i>a</i> amount of nodes are connected to it. This occurs for up to <i>k</i> layers until your browser starts freezing, trying to process so many shapes. I've found that the program works decently smoothly up to around 1400 nodes, with the following settings.</p>

<ul>
<li>n: base nodes = 7</li>
<li>a: number of nodes per node for successive layers = 3</li>
<li>k: number of layers = 6</li>
<li>r: radius of each layer = 60</li>
</ul>

<p>The equation that models the number of nodes total is:</p>

<script type="math/tex">\sum\limits_{i=1}^k n*a^{i-1}</script>

<p>With the current parameters, I get 1456 nodes. If I add another layer, my nodes spike up to 4372.</p>

<p>I connected the nodes as triangulish polygons, with one node from the previous layer and a nodes from the current layer, and then filled them in with a random color using Perlin noise. My basic output would be something like this:</p>

<p><img src="./images/layered_nodes/Layered_Nodes_0.PNG" alt="Layered<em>Nodes</em>0" /></p>

<p>With more layers, you tend to see higher layers devolve into darkness since there is a larger node density despite the increased radius size. Therefore layers beyond 7 are probably not going to look very interesting.</p>

<p>So after drawing a static image, the next rational thing to do is to make it dynamic. So I added rotation for each layer, based on the framecount of the program.</p>

<p><img src="./images/layered_nodes/Layered_Nodes_2.PNG" alt="Layered<em>Nodes</em>2" /></p>

<p>Tada! A rotating eyeball! Let's add an offset to each layer (but just enough so it doesn't cause layers to come out of each other).</p>

<h4>Additional things from this program:</h4>

<p>The coordinates of each node are determined are generated from the <em>sine</em> and <em>cosine</em> functions. I used the following formulas:</p>

<div align="center">
    <script type="math/tex">
        x=radius \times layer \times \cos{(\frac{2 \times \pi \times node}{Max Layer Nodes})}+xOffset
    </script>
</div>

<div align="center">
    <script style="align:center;" type="math/tex">
        y=radius \times layer \times \sin{(\frac{2 \times \pi \times node}{Max Layer Nodes})}+yOffset
    </script>
</div>

<p>where I cycled through each node for each layer. Each node in a layer
was pushed to a set called a <em>nodeLayer</em>, and each nodeLayer was pushed into an all encompassing set <em>nodes</em>.</p>

<p>Creating these node sets enabled me to draw shapes based on their vertices and color them in, as well as make them spin, using p5's rotate() function.</p>

<p>Here's a gallery of some of the Generative Art I've created with this program.</p>

<div class="flex-container">

        <div id="G001Gallery" class="panel"></div>
        <script>
            let G001Container = document.getElementById("G001Gallery");
            let G001Pictures = ["png", "aligningMirors", "circleStructure", "eyeball", "mechanicalSun", "rotatingDrums"];
            for (let i = 1; i < G001Pictures.length; i++) {
                let src = "./images/layered_nodes/" + G001Pictures[i] + "." + G001Pictures[0];
                let img = new Image();
                img.src = src;
                G001Container.appendChild(img);
            }
        </script>
