<h1>Flow Fields</h1>

<h4>November 20th, 2018</h4>

<p>Flow Field is one of the earliest sets of generative art programs that I've made, based off of Dan Schiffman's P5JS tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdgiqMkFygc&amp;list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Z9hI4mSgx2FlE5w8zvjmEy&quot;">series</a>. At the time of making this, I was particularly intrigued by the use of particle systems to simulate movement and forces; I wanted to use Perlin Noise to create a field of "movement", enabling particles inside of this field to follow naturally determined paths.</p>

<p><img src="./images/flowfield/Flowfield1.png" alt="Flowfield." /></p>

<p>I generated the map of Perlin noise by setting a vector at each x,y coordinate of the canvas; the angle of the vector is of the function</p>

<script type="math/tex">angle = noise(xOff, yOff, zOff) * 2\pi * 5</script>

<p>The perlin noise function is similar to the random function except that the perlin noise function is <em>differentiable</em>, which means that between any two points, say</p>

<script type="math/tex">f(t) \quad and \quad f(t + \vec{\Delta} t)</script>

<p>There will be a set of points between the two times such that the function will always be continuous (no breaks), and will never have a an infinite vertical slope (no jumping between values). Below is an example of a differentiable function.</p>

<p><img src="./images/flowfield/differentiable.png" alt="differentiable" /></p>

<p>This effect is displayed in our noise function by the direction and color of our vectors of the flowfield; each one is slightly offset to each other relative to their position and to time. None of them will immediately change direction.</p>

<p>This means that a particle in the field will experience gradual changes in its force, allowing it move much like an object in a current of water.</p>

<p>I created a particle class whose movement is based on the "force" of the vector in which the particle exists at (think in units of cells, [0, 0], etc) and added some color. Here are the results!</p>

<div class="flex-container">
    <section>
        <button class="accordion"><h2>FlowField</h2></button>
        <div id="FlowFieldGallery" class="panel"></div>
        <script>
            let FlowFieldContainer = document.getElementById("FlowFieldGallery");
            let FlowFieldPictures = ["png", "flowfield1", "flowfield2", "flowfield3", "flowfield4", "flowfield5", "flowfield6", "heatmap", "rainbowrain", "wormtunnels"];
            for (let i = 1; i < FlowFieldPictures.length; i++) {
                let src = "./images/flowfield/" + FlowFieldPictures[i] + "." + FlowFieldPictures[0];
                let img = new Image();
                img.src = src;
                FlowFieldContainer.appendChild(img);
            }
        </script>
    </section>
</div>

<p>For the ones with the particles hidden, the field looks a lot like a heatmap, although the color is based on the direction and the time of the vector rather than its magnitude. I would like to create another program in the future that uses a sort of gravity as the force, and have the color be based on the magnitude of that gravity. For example, I could use a grayscale image as a base and the darker the pixel the stronger the gravity...</p>
